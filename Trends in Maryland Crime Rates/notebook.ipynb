Maryland crime data\n<p>Crime rates change and can vary across space and time. Reasons and even trends can be difficult to detect, due to many complex factors driving crime. Despite this uncertainty, policymakers need to know if crime rates are changing to inform their decisions.</p>\n<p>We will explore <a href=\"http://goccp.maryland.gov/crime-statistics/\">crime statistics</a> collected between 1975 and 2016 from the State of Maryland. We will see if linear trends exist in crime rates across Maryland. This data comes from the <a href=\"https://ccjs.umd.edu/research/maryland-data-analysis-center\">Maryland Statistical Analysis Center</a>. </p>\n<p>We will use regression analysis because it allows estimation of linear trends. But, some datasets can be hierarchical or nested, which presents a regression challenge. Many government statistics, such as crime rates, come from nested datasets. For example, counties exist within most US states (Alaska has “burrows,” and  Louisiana has “parishes”).  Counties and county-level governments vary even within the same state.  For example, one county might have a high population density and be urban whereas a second county might have a low population density and be rural. </p>\n<p>Hierarchical modeling allows us to capture and model this hierarchy. This figure shows the counties and their populations in Maryland. We will create a similar figure for their crime trends at the end of this project.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://assets.datacamp.com/production/project_673/./img/countyPop.jpg\" alt=\"Map of Maryland counties and population\"></p>\n<p>Before running a regression analysis, we often need to tidy data.
